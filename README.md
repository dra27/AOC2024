# Advent of Code 2024

Idly-coded solutions to [Advent of Code 2024][].

Worked for my inputs; hopefully not so idly written that they fail for others'!

OCaml solutions written because it's nice to actually write some OCaml
occasionally...

Each script assumes that the input has been put in `input-n`, for example
`ocaml day01.ml` expects to read `input-01`.
